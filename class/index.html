			<h2>Why is it important to wear masks to prevent the spread of non-coVID-19</h2>
			<p>
				 The non-coronavirus must reach a certain level before it can pass through the
				 body's layers of resistance and enter the body's nucleus, where it multiplies and 
				 becomes ill. This is why morbidity and mortality rates are much lower in young 
				 children and young adults. Children and young people have strong immunity, and 
				 the same amount of virus is much less likely to escape the immune resistance of
				 children and young people and enter the nucleus. Therefore, most or even most 
				 of children and young people do not develop disease and develop immune resistance 
				 to the virus after infection.
			</p>
			<p>
				If people do not wear masks, sufficient amount of virus is more likely to be released 
				continuously through the breathing of infected people, and enter the mouth and nose of 
				healthy people in close enclosed places in the form of aerosol breathing, and cause 
				others to have a greater probability of infection and illness.
			</p>
			<p>
				Wearing masks can prevent most of the virus from spreading in the infected body, and 
				other healthy people wearing masks can prevent most of the virus from inhaling enough 
				virus through their own breathing to cause infection or illness. Therefore, transmission 
				through aerosol oral and nasal breathing can cause sufficient amount of virus to be 
				infected and the possibility of disease is extremely small or even very small
